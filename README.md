hi this is for my homework for it step or just projects and learning which i wanted to have 
--UPDATE: Have i forgotten about this? 
No, actually. I keep this deep and near my heart but unfrotuantly to run C ill need some more priveleges like running things on the C:// instead of this file path.
because i am looking into a computer architect degree, id need to learn low level languages work. thats why i chose C. C is pretty cool. If ill be able to make a new repo about C, ill upload it on github.
